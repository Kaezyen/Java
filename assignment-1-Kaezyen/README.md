## Assignment #1: Basic Computations

In this assignment we are going to build the very simplest example of payroll processing possible. It will take no input.

Given a fixed hourly rate, and a fixed number of hours, compute the gross payroll for the period and display the properly formatted results for employee Bob Smith.

1. Fixed hourly rate = $11.25
2. Fixed number of hours = 15

### Output expected:

Bob Smith worked 15 hours at $11.25 per hour for a gross of $168.75

### Notes and specifications:

1. The rate and number of hours must be stored in variables
2. The computation must also be stored in a variable
3. Output should exactly match what is shown above

### Expectations:

- You must use variables
- You should comment your code intelligently
