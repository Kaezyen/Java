## Assignment #7: Format output

In this assignment we will properly format all our output.

So, wherever we output $0.0 or $0.000000001 it should now output dollar amounts as:

$xxxx.xx where the left side is as long as it needs to be, and the right side is always two digits.

$123.45, $1.24, $123456.78 are valid examples.

_Hint:_ _printf_
